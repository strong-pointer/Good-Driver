Django vs. React
- https://cloudinfrastructureservices.co.uk/django-vs-react-whats-the-difference/
- Pros of Django
    - Django is quick to install and can run operations faster.
    - The administrative features have an intuitive user interface.
    - Create and build multilingual websites using its in built internationalization system.
    - Assists in developing dynamic HTML pages.
    - Integrated unit testing system and a fully featured administration interface.
    - Offers low cost for hosting services and manual maintenance.
    - Highly secure and supports policies for throttling and permissions.
    - Unlike other frameworks, Django provides support for foundational technologies, templates, tools, and plugins
    - Customizable and helps developers in defining models for the Application URLs.
- Cons of Django
    - Django follows a monolithic working style that can complicate things.
    - Auto reload feature that can restart your entire server.
    - The Django framework allows only one request at a time.
    - Errors in the template default to silent failure.
    - Experience and basic knowledge are necessary before using this framework.
    - The high end framework has various functions, thus making it not a great option for simple projects.
    - Django serves a very large codebase size and it may get more complication for it uses URL dispatching through controller regex.
    - The supporting documentation does not address real world scenarios.
- Pros of React
    - React.js builds a custom virtual DOM that helps enhance the performance of apps. A JavaScript virtual DOM is quicker than a conventional DOM.
    - Component and Data patterns supported by the framework aid in improving readability, great for large apps.
    - ReactJS is SEO friendly, offers several helpful developer toolsets, and has a strong community. 
    - Notable features include the acceptance of HTML code and the facilitation of sub component rendering.
    - Compatible with other frameworks and has the ability to update UI faster than other libraries.
    - Awesome UI may be created with ReactJS.
    - Allows redistributing similar digital objects that help boost productivity.
    - Easy to learn and  helps developers to complete projects faster.
- Cons of React
    - Does not offer enough documentation for guidance.
    - React cannot be used to construct an entire app. 
    - Not a good option for a larger project or one that has many components.
    - Do not support server side rendering.
    - It is not great in terms of deployment and scaling for it does not offer many features
